# Raytracing: developing a 3D renderer from zero
Project developed as the subject of my thesis and apprenticeship for my Batchelor's degree in Computer Science at University of Rome "La Sapienza".

My supervisor professor for this project was [Professor Maurizio Mancini](https://corsidilaurea.uniroma1.it/it/users/mauriziomanciniuniroma1it****): 

The following code is developed following this essential series of books:

- [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)
- [_Ray Tracing: The Next Week_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheNextWeek.html)

and with the help of this wonderful collection of lessons:
- [_Scratch Pixel_](https://www.scratchapixel.com/index.html)

Many thanks to the authors of these books, that have release them for free and completely open source:
_Peter Shirley, Trevor David Black, Steve Hollasch (Raytracing in one week) and Jean-Colas Prunier (Scratch Pixel)._

I've used the following two libraries to handle models I/O and texture I/O

- [_plycpp_](https://github.com/rbregier/plycpp) - to handle .ply 
- [stb_image.h](https://github.com/nothings/stb) - to handle textures
